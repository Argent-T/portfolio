                <p>Hello and welcome to my coding bootcamp portfolio. My name is Thomas Argent. I'm currently employed
                    at Amazon.com as a learning data analyst.
                    As lovely as my current job is, I hope to expand and improve my skills to open up multiple career
                    opportunities for myself instead of continuing to
                    rely on the uncanny good luck that has gotten me this far. Some of my personal interests are
                    videogames, Mystery Science Theater 3000, my two daschunds, and working on multiple different
                    mediums of art.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Already by week three we are working on responsive websites. I am impressed at the speed this class
                    is going and I certainly endeavor to keep up with this breakneck pace! While I dont have much else
                    to say here right now, I encourage you to keep an eye on this site as this is only the first step in
                    a long and exciting future.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my full stack coding bootcamp portfolio</p>
