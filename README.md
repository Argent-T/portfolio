# Thomas Argent Portfolio

## Purpose

This repository contains the projects completed during coding bootcamp and will also contain personal projects built to hone my abilities. 


## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Make modifications to html, assets, and css as necessary
3. Push the changes to your repository or host 

## Usage
At present, the website contains three pages. "About", "Contact", and "Portfolio". 
The website can be navigated using the three links on the right side of the header.

## About
The about page contains a brief description about who I am, how I got to where I am, and what my motivations are for the future. 

## Contact
The contact page currently does not function, however its intended purpose will be to allow interested parties to easily reach out to me to provide employment opportunities or feedback on my projects.

## Portfolio
The portfolio page will house links to the various projects both inside and outside the coding bootcamp.
